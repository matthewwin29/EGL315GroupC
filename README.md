# Theme

## **Theme choice**
The theme we have chosen for our 315 Module is **Multiplayer Bomb Defusal**, We chose this theme as we want to give our players a thrilling experience as they try to defuse a bomb within 20 or 30 seconds while also making it competitive between 2 humans.


## **Intention of use**
We intend to give our users/players a memorable, immersive, competitive and interactive multiplayer experience that will require them to click buttons according to a sequence to make it our "alive".

## **Hardware Used**

    ~ Used to control the buttons and ir sensors

- Speakers

  ## Software used
- Christie's Pandora Box
